                The most valuable programming skill? It actually hasn’t changed since the 1960s, it’s only become more important, as the size and complexity of the software we develop has increased. The most important skill is

                <h2>Abstraction</h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to recognize common patterns in the desired behavior of the program and organize your code around them. The ability to design systems and to structure code so that whenever X happens, so does Y. The ability to structure loops so that they’re always executed the right number of times and so each statement is executed always and only when it should be. The ability to structure data so that the requisite parts are always present when they should be, never when they shouldn’t be, and it’s always possible to find the information that may be needed. The ability to document your code in an approachable way, so that the most important parts can be understood without having to understand all the details first. The ability to recognize and apply the appropriate architectural or design patterns for the current situation. All of these things are the abstraction.

                    Edsger W. Dijkstra observed this in 1972: <blockquote> effective exploitation of his powers of abstraction must be regarded as one of the most vital activities of a competent programmer.</blockquote> He also said that <blockquote>We all know that the only mental tool by means of which a finite piece of reasoning can cover a myriad cases is called <strong>abstraction</strong>; as a result the effective exploitation of his powers of abstraction must be regarded as one of the most vital activities of a competent programmer.</blockquote> True in the 1970s, and even more now.
